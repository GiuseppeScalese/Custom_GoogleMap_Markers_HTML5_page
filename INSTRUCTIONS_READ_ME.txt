Run the index.html page and check the test out.

The test has been implemented both on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It is fully responsive - mobile version availale.
Also, the test is IE compatible. IE9(included) onwards.

I've used SASS, HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, and GRUNT as JS task runner. Naming convention BEM, OOCSS and SMACCS.

From the terminal, run "GRUNT" in order to compile the whole project running all tasks.
Otherwise run each task singularly.
